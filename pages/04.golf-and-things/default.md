title: 'Golf & Things'

Here is where I have information about golf stuff.

Funny thing... it was a place called "Golf & Things" that I loved as a kid. It was a miniature golf playground that I first "putted" on purple astroturf. Later, it was changed to Golf & Stuff after I moved away, but it's still there, in the same building and place, and it is partially responsible for addicting me to the game of golf.
