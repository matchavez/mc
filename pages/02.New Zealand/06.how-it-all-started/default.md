So how did I get interested the very first time about New Zealand? It's pretty random in a sense. I was studying Finance at uni, and I had my new computer up and running. This was in 1998, so of course, your fancy new Windows computer came with a compact disc called Encarta. This was of course the "olden days" before Google and Wikipedia.
