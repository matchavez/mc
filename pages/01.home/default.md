## Here we go...

I haven't been quite so excited to roll out a platform in a while. As a Wordpress user for 14 years, and also someone who has played around with Kirby, I knew there was something between the two that would work. In comes Grav. Much lighter than Wordpress, and no database. Like Kirby, it's Markdown. But the admin and plug-in structure works better, and it's a lot more polished. Unlike WP, it's static. This means that it's actually portable, and so much so, I'm actually going to try using it for notetaking. Just needs PHP.

Anyhow, the site is going to be a mix of things. Dropping off of Facebook has been very healthy, and now it's time to get back to creating content for me, not for someone else. This is my playground, and I'm going to talk about tech things, golf things, and also New Zealand things. It's a beautiful place, so I'm looking forward to showing it off.

Thanks, and enjoy the content.
