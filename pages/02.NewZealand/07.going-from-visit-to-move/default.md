title: 'Going from visit to move'
---

It's not so easy to say "I want to fly 10,000 miles away to live". How people decided to do that as pioneers astonishes me. We don't have that anymore; we've all seen Mars at this point, so Google Earth lets us see anything we haven't already. However it was the confluence of technologies that really made me feel comfortable.

All at about the same time, iPhones and FaceTime were easy enough for my parents to use. Communication is trivial in comparison to 20 years ago. It's not $2/minute to call people; it's free. Email, text, voice, video... all trivial in its complexity, and this more than anything said that there is no longer an excuse to think of *anywhere* as "far away". Nothing is all that far anymore.

The big jump, the leap of faith, that's something that I didn't take on until I had a practical idea of what would happen. Years of poking around, reading local news sites, job boards, immigration forums, and even connecting to some random people through Twitter made the barrier of moving lower and lower all the time. But it always comes down to making a decision of whether it's a place you like to have a holiday, or if it's a place you want to call home. This requires a visit.

Visiting New Zealand is not a small task, *unless* you look at it as a prerequisite for a moving decision. What would otherwise be a vacation of a lifetime, it becomes what they call a "recce" (pron. "wreckie") here, or a reconnaissance trip. Sure, you take a trip to enjoy yourself, but if you're travelling with an eye of moving, you view things differently.

You go to a grocery, and price things. You poke around real estate listings. You read a book or two about what it's like to move. You confirm. You place yourself like furniture in a potential residence; can you see yourself as this being a new normal? Do people accept others? Will you be viewed with a skeptical eye? What is it like to be the outsider for the first time?

And then you realise... all of those differences you thought about as a kid. All the prejudice, all the insulation... it falls away. You feel a bit off that you ever thought those things in the first place. You realise the sun rises and sets all the same. It's your planet, so be there. Why not be where you want to be, right?

So then you've been. And you want to be. Only then does the hard work start.
