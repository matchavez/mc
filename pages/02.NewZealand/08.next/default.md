I imagine that anyone who contemplates leaving their home country probably has two thoughts at some point. First, it's "yes, I am going to do this. I am committed." Then right after, it's, "What do I have to do to make this a reality?"

Really, it's the second question that's the big deal. Making a decision that there's something you really want is fine, but the reality is the decision also means you're going to be asking a government for their permission to live in their country. And if you get that permission, you also have to consider the logistics involved. This means not only figuring out your work and income situation, but also getting your stuff and maybe also your family over with you.
