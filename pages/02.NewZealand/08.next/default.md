I imagine that anyone who contemplates leaving their home country probably has two thoughts at some point. First, it's "yes, I am going to do this. I am committed." Then right after, it's, "What do I have to do to make this a reality?"

Really, it's the second question that's the big deal. Making a decision that there's something you really want is fine, but the reality is the decision also means you're going to be asking a government for their permission to live in their country. And if you get that permission, you also have to consider the logistics involved. This means not only figuring out your work and income situation, but also getting your stuff and maybe also your family over with you.

So what I'd start out with as "advice" is that you will have to understand and accept a few things:

- You aren't the local, so don't pretend
- You must be prepared to show proof of being able to work
- You must also accept that employers have been burned by people like you in the past

It's not easy, but unless you are lucky enough to possess a greatly needed skill which makes you unique and worth the trouble, employers here in New Zealand don't care how badly you want the job. The cover letters, the CVs, they can all be perfect. You'll likely even get a call, and maybe even a Skype interview. That's about it, over and over. They want to talk to you, and they might think you're a good candidate. However, the likelihood of converting this into a job offer is only under the condition that you already have your tickets and housing sorted. They want an in-person interview. Step 2 is in Aotearoa, and you're not moving on without that plan in place, or actually being here on the ground.

!!! Aotearoa is the placename of New Zealand in Maori. Many words are commonly and freely exchanged between Te Reo and English.
