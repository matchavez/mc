title: 'How It All Started'
---

So how did I get interested the very first time about New Zealand? It's pretty random in a sense. I was studying Finance at uni, and I had my new computer up and running. This was in 1998, so of course, your fancy new Windows computer came with a compact disc called **Encarta**. This was of course the "olden days" before Google and Wikipedia.

So I was playing around with my fancy new computer while I was at uni, and I asked myselfâ€¦ "self, where would you retire if you could choose anywhere in the world?" It's a broad question, but with the CD whirring in the now-stupidly-large computer tower drive, I started to poke around. The conclusive answer was New Zealand, and probably the South Island. However, as is the folly of youth, I asked some questions based around inexperience.

When I was younger, I was under the impression that jobs were only "real" jobs in the good ol' U S of A. And maybe in the late 1990s, that wasn't far from the truth. The plan was to have a career, "make money" (hah), and then when I have a bundle, off I went to an island "retreat".

It turns out that in all that hubris, I did do something right. And for me, that was to create a "bucket list" item of visiting New Zealand. If for nothing else, that started it all.
