title: 'Winner First'
---

I hate reviews that make you click through a bunch of options before getting to the point. So please allow me to tell you here what I think the best system is.

## Winner - No Single Application

What? Nothing? No, not nothing. It's a **combination** of apps that make up a very helpful system.

- Dropbox
- Markdown; specifically GFM
- Typora
- 1Writer

These 4 things work together to offer what I'm looking for, both with capabilities and without lockin. Here's how it works:

### Dropbox
You're probably familiar with Dropbox as it's everywhere. 10GB free for anyone is outstanding, but it has an additional appeal of working in areas where you might not expect. Dropbox can be installed in corporate environments, usually, _without administrative privileges!_ This means that you probably don't have to ask... you just install it. Don't go breaking any rules at work, but when you download Dropbox and you're not an admin, it'll ask if you want to install on Windows without admin. You say yes, and then it installs a "reduced" version. It seems to use some more old-school sync methods, but it still works. This means you can have a folder on Mac, Linux, and even Windows! Android and iOS are also just as available, so you're working directly with files, and Dropbox does the sync.

##### Runner-Up - iCloud
A more secure service, but limiting with Linux and Android.

### Markdown (GitHub-Flavoured Markdown, specifically)
Why is a format part of the solution? John Gruber's original approach, and the one adopted and transformed into what's known as "GFM", is a way to write _plain text_ that is formatted. This means hashtags for headings and asterisks for bolding. It is completely readable as-is. It's not as pretty, but it is obvious when you read a completely plain text file that what you put underscores around is intended to be emphasised. It's a little like "shorthand html", but instead of writing `<h1>Heading</h1>` and surrounding all your text with HTML, you just write `# Heading`. This means that not only do you not _export_ your files, you simply work with the _raw file_ as it is. Using certain smart applications will apply those formats, and that lets you keep your original in an "application-agnostic" format.

### Typora
Typora is my main writing app on the desktop. It does one trick that no other app (as of yet) does, and it's amazing.
