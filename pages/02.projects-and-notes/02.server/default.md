This site is being served off of a MacMini, on my desk. It's a 2012 Mini; the last one with USB2. It's a tank, and it's going to be around a while. Upgraded to 16g ram, and it has a 480mb flash disk for its main storage, along with an upgraded 2T 7200rpm.

The site itself is being served not from Apache or Nginx, but from a small but powerful web server called [Abyss X2](https://aprelium.com). Aprelium Software has been writing this for a very long time, and it is a much easier way to host multiple domains than anything else I've seen.
