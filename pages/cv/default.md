### Personal Profile

###### _See my profile on [LinkedIn](linkedin.com/in/matchavez)._

I am an experienced and adaptable manager capable of streamlining processes, implementing agile tools, and improving quality and outcomes in challenging environments. I'm looking for an opportunity to expand my responsibilities, and use multiple areas of experience to bridge gaps and drive improvement.

#### Quality and Change/Release Manager, Cyber @ Telstra

###### Dates Employed: Sep 2016 – Present
###### Location: Christchurch, New Zealand

Currently, I run our Quality and Release programs for proprietary network security software. It's my job to ensure general quality, acceptance, and safe deployment within our operational teams. I have implemented our current test management system, and also automated the documentation process for our technical writer. I chair our Change Advisory Board for risk assessment of deployments, working with our teams in Melbourne and Sydney. As part of maintaining and improving the processes for releases, and our mature agile approach, I administer our JIRA and Confluence instances.


#### Independent Developer and SMB Consultant

Dates: 2014 – 2016
Location: Dallas/Fort Worth, Texas

I worked with several clients to help their organisations with technology. This work requires an understanding of what businesses do, and how they need to market their message. I help provide content, testing, and marketing choices for their online presence. This includes widely varying clients, for example: 
- A youth music ensemble in the Chicago area 
- A golf equipment and lessons company in the Dallas area 
- A small family winery here in Christchurch

After eight years of volunteering, I accepted a full time position to manage the entire company’s technology. I budgeted and ran the live streaming operation and generated nearly $1M annual revenue in various digital forms. I had several employees, interns, and volunteers to assist running the production and maintenance of the platform we created. This was presented in 2012 to a conference as an example of how to lower costs without compromising quality. I reported directly to the CEO, and provided reporting for the DCI Board.

As the “SA”, I was responsible for business development with Microsoft for testing services. I was responsible for about $4M in revenue, including the design and implementation of a $1.1M deal to test Office 2007 in Ballina, Ireland.

Most of this position was work-from-home, independently managing the content output, and the quality delivered to our sales representatives.

After starting as an intern in 1999, I was tasked with doing updates and management training for Y2K.
