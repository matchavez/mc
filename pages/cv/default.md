### Personal Profile

###### _See my profile on [LinkedIn](linkedin.com/in/matchavez)._

I am an experienced and adaptable manager capable of streamlining processes, implementing agile tools, and improving quality and outcomes in challenging environments. I'm looking for an opportunity to expand my responsibilities, and use multiple areas of experience to bridge gaps and drive improvement.

#### Quality and Change/Release Manager, Cyber @ [Telstra](https://security.telstra.com/login)
###### Sep 2016 – Present / Christchurch, New Zealand

Currently, I run our Quality and Release programs for proprietary network security software. It's my job to ensure general quality, acceptance, and safe deployment within our operational teams. I have implemented our current test management system, and also automated the documentation process for our technical writer. I chair our Change Advisory Board for risk assessment of deployments, working with our teams in Melbourne and Sydney. As part of maintaining and improving the processes for releases, and our mature agile approach, I administer our JIRA and Confluence instances.


#### Independent Developer and SMB Consultant
###### 2014 – 2016 /  Greater Dallas Area

I worked with several clients to help their organisations with technology. This work requires an understanding of what businesses do, and how they need to market their message. I help provide content, testing, and marketing choices for their online presence. This includes widely varying clients, for example: 
- A [youth music ensemble](https://regiment.org) in the Chicago area 
- A golf equipment and lessons company in the Dallas area 
- A small family winery here in Christchurch

###### 2008 – 2013 (Volunteered annually from 2001-2008) / Indianapolis, Indiana

After eight years of volunteering, I accepted a full time position to manage the company’s technology strategy. I budgeted and ran the live streaming operation and generated nearly $1M annual revenue. I had several employees, interns, and volunteers to assist running the production and maintenance of the platform we created. This was presented in 2012 to a live-streaming conference as an example of how to lower costs without compromising quality. I reported directly to the CEO, and provided reporting for the DCI Board.

As the team architect, I was responsible for providing technical expertise to our business development with Microsoft. I was responsible for about $4M in revenue, including the design and implementation of a $1.1M deal to test Office 2007 in Ballina, Ireland. Critical to this position was cultivating relationships with Microsoft directors to ensure completeness and to set expectations for testing programs.
