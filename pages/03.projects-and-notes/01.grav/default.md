title: Grav
---

Grav is the content management system that runs this website. While I could go on and on about why I was unhappy with other things, the key factor for why I like this software is pretty simple.

- Unlike most content systems, Grav does not require a database. Just PHP.
- Grav understands Markdown, and specifically GFM.
- The theme I'm running is "Learn2". It's a riff of "Read The Docs", and it works pretty well.

There are some things I've had to adapt for Learn2, as with any system and theme. I run through that on another technical page.

If you're looking to get a website running, and you want to host it yourself, Grav makes it very simple. Even if you want to take advantage of inexpensive hosting that's available, all you need is PHP7, and you will have a very responsive, snappy site.
