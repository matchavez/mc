There is a step the Chch crew is missing. Along with turning on the livestream in the OBS software you also have to do it within YouTube itself. Below are the steps.



**Going live to YouTube:**

1. Open up Google Chrome browser and go to [YouTube.com](http://youtube.com/)
2. Sign in details if required: [livestream@nzihl.com](mailto:livestream@nzihl.com) / password: NZIHL2005
3. Click NZIHL logo at the top right corner and open ‘Creator Studio’
4. Go into ‘Events’ under Live Streaming options on the left side of screen
5. Find your game in the event listing and click ‘Live Control Room’
6. The output from OBS will show in the preview window and stream status will also appear indicating the strength of your data rate and internet speed
7. Click the ‘Preview’ button - after 30-60 seconds of testing the button will update to say ‘Start Stream’ - click this and you will now be live!
