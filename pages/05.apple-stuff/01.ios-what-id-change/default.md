title: 'iOS - What I''d Change'
---

#### _This is what I would change:_

---

First up, iOS seems to make no sense when leaning from vertical to horizontal. It sets an array in order, 1-through-24, and it resets them. A much easier approach would be to leave the app icons exactly where they are, and just rotate them. It's a lot less jarring, and easier to find. Why this isn't an option 12 versions in, I have no idea. And only 20 on iPad? Really??

---

The "back" choice to return to the previous application has a ridiculously small target, but it is relatively usable. It's just not the same colour as other tap links, so you have to know that's what it is.

---

iPads have the "Show Date in Status Bar" option, but iPhones don't. Why not? Just require that the date format be small.

---

If you pull up from the bottom on iPhone, it's the same as if you pull from the upper right corner of an iPad. Why?

All iDevices should allow a mode you can boot into that accept an HDMI signal. All of those old iPads doing nothing... well, they could be a Raspberry Pi screen, a gaming screen, a second monitor... not something to be thrown away.
