## Markdown Preview Enhanced

##### _This plug-in is available for either Atom or VSCode_

In either editor, you'll need to go to the plugin manager for the application. In the installation area, search for:

`Markdown Preview Enhanced`

It's also available at the following sites:

[Atom installation documentation](https://shd101wyy.github.io/markdown-preview-enhanced/#/installation)

[VSCode installation documentation](https://shd101wyy.github.io/markdown-preview-enhanced/#/vscode-installation)

Once you install this plugin, go to the Settings for the plugin, and add a check for "Enable Script Execution". If you're not comfortable with that for some reason, you can keep the scripts from the prior page separate. They pose no danger on their own, but if you work in a shared environment, or a highly secured environment, this might be something to check with your Administrator.

Once installed, this will allow you to preview markdown nicely, export it, and run the combining script all within your editor.
