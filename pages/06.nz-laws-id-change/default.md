title: 'NZ Laws I''d Change'

#### If I could wave a wand, and make changes, these are what I think would be right.

### Public Doors must remain open during business hours
Any public building that is open must unlock all main doors. If there is maintenance being done on a door, it must be clearly marked. Having, for example, double doors where one side is locked is dangerous, and is an unnecessary safety issue. Also, doors should swing OUT.

### Well water export banned
Simply, if water is pulled out of the ground, it cannot be exported. If this isn't legal, an export tax of 5Â¢ per litre would be sufficient.

---

### No GST on unpackaged foods
Any foods that are sold without packaging should be untaxed at its final point of sale. Stickers that give originating nation or PLU are acceptable. For example, potatoes sold loose, no tax. Potatoes sold in a box, taxed. Bulk walnuts sold using customer-provided container, untaxed. Walnuts from bulk put into a plastic bag, taxed.

This would serve to act as tax relief for those who need it the most, reduce packaging, and promote better food choices.

### "Self-Contained" regulation overhauled
Seeing stickers around that say "self-contained" are really a joke. There needs to be two classes of camper vehicles here. Right now, so-called "self-contained" vehicles simply have to have a portable toilet that fits inside, and can be stored after use. This means that almost any vehicle could qualify, and it's not good. What it means to be self-contained is that the vehicle should have a "cassette" toilet where you can use it, and drive away. If you want to have a "campground licensed" vehicle, then anyone using that vehicle and gets caught deficating outside can then be fined heavily. $1000/incident in my opinion. It also means that you cannot rent/hire out a vehicle that is "campground licensed". Visitors would then have the choice between campsites with facilities, or renting a vehicle that truly is self-contained.
