#### _This is what I would change:_

Messenger App - On the left side, you have a list of your most recent messages. On almost any other messenger app, you have an indicator whether the last message was written by you or the other person. In iOS, you can see this clearly based on colour, but you still have the problem. In MacOS, there is absolutely no indication. You have to open the conversation, which makes the last message less useful.
