title: 'iOS - What I''d Change'
---

Here's what I'd change:

First up, iOS seems to make no sense when leaning from vertical to horizontal. It sets an array in order, 1through 24, and it resets them. A much easier approach would be to leave the app icons exactly where they are, and just rotate them. It's a lot less jarring, and easier to find. Why this isn't an option 12 versions in, I have no idea.

The "back" choice to return to the previous application has a ridiculously small target, but it is relatively usable. It's just not the same colour as other tap links, so you have to know that's what it is.

iPads have the "Show Date in Status Bar" option, but iPhones don't. Why not? Just require that the date format be small.

If you pull up from the bottom on iPhone, it's the same as if you pull from the upper right corner of an iPad. Why?
