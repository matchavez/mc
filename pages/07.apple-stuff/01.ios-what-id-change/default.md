title: 'iOS - What I''d Change'
---

Here's what I'd change:

First up, iOS seems to make no sense when leaning from vertical to horizontal. It sets an array in order, 1through 24, and it resets them. A much easier approach would be to leave the app icons exactly where they are, and just rotate them. It's a lot less jarring, and easier to find. Why this isn't an option 12 versions in, I have no idea.
